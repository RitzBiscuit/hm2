        <h1 class="display-1">About Volcanic Eruptions</h1><br>
        <h2>During a Volcanic Eruption:</h2>
        <ul>Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately from the volcano area to avoid flying debris, hot gases, lateral blast and lava flow. <br>
            Be aware of mudflows. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching.
            Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas. <br>
            Remember to help your neighbours who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people and people with access and functional needs. <br>
        </ul>
        <h2>Protection from Falling Ash:</h2>
        <ul>If you are unable to evacuate, and in order to protect yourself from falling ash, you should remain indoors with doors, windows and ventilation closed until the ash settles.<br>
            If you have a respiratory ailment, avoid contact with any amount of ash. Stay indoors until local health officials advise it is safe to go outside.<br>
            Listen to a battery-powered radio or television for the latest emergency information.<br>
            Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.<br>
            Use goggles and wear eyeglasses instead of contact lenses.<br>
            Use a dust mask or hold a damp cloth over your face to help with breathing.<br>
            Stay away from areas downwind from the volcano to avoid volcanic ash.<br>
            Stay indoors until the ash has settled unless there is a danger of the roof collapsing.<br>
            Close doors, windows, and all ventilation in the house (chimney vents, furnaces, air conditioners, fans and other vents.<br>
            Clear heavy ash from flat or low-pitched roofs and rain gutters.<br>
            Avoid running car or truck engines. Driving can stir up volcanic ash that can clog engines, damage moving parts, and stall vehicles.<br>
            Avoid driving in heavy ash fall unless absolutely required. If you have to drive, keep speed down to 35 MPH or slower.<br>
        </ul>
