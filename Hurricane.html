        <h2>If a hurricane is likely in your area</h2>
        <ul>
            Listen to the radio or TV for information.<br>
            Secure your home, close storm shutters and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors.<br>
            Turn off utilities if instructed to do so. Otherwise, turn the refrigerator thermostat to its coldest setting and keep its doors closed.<br>
            Turn off propane tanks<br>
            Avoid using the phone, except for serious emergencies.<br>
            Moor your boat if time permits.<br>
            Ensure an adequate supply of water for sanitary purpose such as cleaning and flushing toilets. Fill the bathtub and other larger containers with water.<br>
            Find out how to keep food safe during and after and emergency.<br>
        </ul>
        <h2>If you need to evacuate</h2>
        <ul>
            If you live in a mobile home or temporary structure – such shelters are particularly hazardous during hurricane no matter how well fastened to the ground.<br>
            If you live in a high-rise building – hurricane winds are stronger at higher elevations.<br>
            If you live on the coast, on a floodplain, near a river, or on an island waterway.<br></ul>
        <h2>If you are staying inside</h2>
        <ul>Stay indoors during the hurricane and away from windows and glass doors.<br>
            Close all interior doors – secure and brace external doors.<br>
            Keep curtains and blinds closed. Do not be fooled if there is a lull; it could be the eye of the storm – winds will pick up again.<br>
            Take refuge in a small interior room, closet or hallway on the lowest level.<br>
            Lie on the floor under a table or another sturdy object.<br>
            Avoid elevators.<br>
        </ul>
