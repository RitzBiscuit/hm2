        <h2>Feel</h2>
        <ul>
            Strong local earthquakes may cause tsunamis. <br>
            FEEL the ground shaking severely? <br>
            DROP COVER HOLD and then RUN to higher ground <br>
        </ul>
        <h2>See</h2>
        <ul>
            As a tsunami approaches shorelines, the ocean may pull back from the coastline significantly, exposing the ocean floor, reefs and fish. <br>
            SEE an unusual disappearance of water? <br>
            RUN to higher ground <br>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hear</h2>
        <ul>
            A roar like an oncoming train or plane may be heard as a tsunami rushes toward the shore. <br>
            HEAR the roar? <br>
            RUN to higher ground <br>
        </ul>
        <h2>Run</h2>
        <ul>
            Don't wait for official evacuation orders. <br>
            Immediately leave low-lying coastal areas e.g. beaches.<br>
            Do not try to surf the tsunami.<br>
            Move inland to higher ground.<br>
            RUN if you see a tsunami coming!<br>
        </ul>
        <h2>Never go down to the beach to watch for a tsunami. </h2>
        <ul>
            If you detect signs of a tsunami evacuate and move to higher ground at once. <br>
            If possible, stay tuned to a radio, or television or log on to the SRC website at www.uwiseismic.com to get the latest emergency information.<br>
            Never go down to the beach to watch for a tsunami. If you can see the wave, you are already too close to outrun it. /<br>
            A tsunami is not a single wave, but a series of waves that can come ashore for hours. The first wave may not be the largest. Stay out of danger areas until an all-clear is 
            issued by a recognized authority e.g. your local disaster management office.<br>
            If you detect signs of a tsunami move immediately to higher ground!<br>
        </ul>
