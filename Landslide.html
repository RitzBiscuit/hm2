        <h2>Landslides Warning Slides</h2>
        <ul>
            Springs, seeps, or saturated ground in areas that have not typically been wet before.<br>
            New cracks or unusual bulges in the ground, street pavements or sidewalks.<br>
            Soil moving away from foundations.<br>
            Ancillary structures such as decks and patios tilting and/or moving relative to the main house.<br>
            Tilting or cracking of concrete floors and foundations.<br>
            Broken water lines and other underground utilities.<br>
            Leaning telephone poles, trees, retaining walls or fences.<br>
            Offset fence lines.<br>
            Sunken or down-dropped road beds.<br>
            Rapid increase in creek water levels, possibly accompanied by increased turbidity (soil content).<br>
            Sudden decrease in creek water levels though rain is still falling or just recently stopped.<br>
            Sticking doors and windows, and visible open spaces indicating jambs and frames out of plumb.<br>
            A faint rumbling sound that increases in volume is noticeable as the landslide nears.<br>
            Unusual sounds, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together, might indicate moving debris.<br>
        </ul>
        <h2>Areas that are generally prone to landslide hazards</h2>
        <ul>
            On existing old landslides.<br>
            On or at the base of slopes.<br>
            In or at the base of minor drainage hollows.<br>
            At the base or top of an old fill slope.<br>
            At the base or top of a steep cut slope.<br>
            Developed hillsides where leach field septic systems are used.<br>
        </ul>
        <h2>Areas that are typically considered safe from landslides</h2>
        <ul>
            On hard, non-jointed bedrock that has not moved in the past. <br>
            On relatively flat-lying areas away from sudden changes in slope angle.<br>
            At the top or along the nose of ridges, set back from the tops of slopes.<br>
        </ul>
        <h2>What To Do During a Landslide</h2>
        <ul>Stay alert and awake. Many debris-flow fatalities occur when people are sleeping. Listen to a NOAA Weather Radio or portable, battery-powered radio or television for warnings of intense rainfall. Be aware that intense, short bursts of rain may be particularly dangerous, especially after longer periods of heavy rainfall and damp weather.<br>
            If you are in areas susceptible to landslides and debris flows, consider leaving if it is safe to do so. Remember that driving during an intense storm can be hazardous. If you remain at home, move to a second story if possible. Staying out of the path of a landslide or debris flow saves lives.<br>
            Listen for any unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together. A trickle of flowing or falling mud or debris may precede larger landslides. Moving debris can flow quickly and sometimes without warning.<br>
            If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and for a change from clear to muddy water. Such changes may indicate landslide activity upstream, so be prepared to move quickly. Don't delay! Save yourself, not your belongings.<br>
            Be especially alert when driving. Bridges may be washed out, and culverts overtopped. Do not cross flooding streams!! Turn Around, Don't DrownÂ®!. Embankments along roadsides are particularly susceptible to landslides. Watch the road for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other indications of possible debris flows.<br>
            Be aware that strong shaking from earthquakes can induce or intensify the effects of landslides.<br>
        </ul>
